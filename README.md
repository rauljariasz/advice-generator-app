## My process

- First of all, I focus on the layout of the page. Once I got the desired styles, I perform the DOM modification logic each time the API is called.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

My focus for future projects will be API consumption.
